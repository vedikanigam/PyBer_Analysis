# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

This analysis is for ride sharing app company PyBer. Using Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, and jupyter notebook we will write python scripts to perform an exploratory analysis of ride sharing data in different types of cities in rural, suburban, and urban environments. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the relationship between the type of city and number of riders and drivers. We will also compute total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for each city type to understand this relationship better. To showcase this relationship, we will create a data summary and a multi-line graph that shows total fares for different city types on a weekly basis.  

## Results

![Ride Sharing Summary]()

- **Total Rides** -
Based on the ride summary above, we can see that the percentage of total number of rides in urban cities (68.5%) far outpace the rides in rural(5.2%) and suburban cities(26.3%).

- **Total Drivers** -
Similarly, the share of the number of drivers is much higher in urban cities(80.9%) than rural (2.6%) and suburban cities(20.4%). 

- **Total Fares** -
Since, more number of rides are undertaken in urban cities, the total fares collected in these cities (approx. 62.5%) is also higher compared to rural(approx. 6.9%) and suburban cities(approx. 30.5%). However, the total fare percentages for rural and suburban cities are higher when compared to total rides and drivers in these cities.

- **Average Fare per Ride** -
Since, the share of total fares in rural and suburban cities is higher, the average fare per ride in rural cities($34.62) and suburban cities($30.97) is higher when compared to urban cities($24.53). 

- **Average Fare per Driver** -
The average ride per driver is also much higher in rural($55.49) and suburban cities($39.50) in comparison to urban cities($16.57).


![Total Fare by City Type]
Finally, after plotting a multi-line graph for total fares per week for the months of January to April, we can see the total fares per week are highest for urban cities followed by suburban and then rural cities. There is more volatility in total fares collected in urban and suburban cities compared to rural cities.  

## Summary 
Based on the analysis above we can recommend the following-

Since, there are less drivers per ride in rural and suburban cities there is an opportunity market in both these city types to hire more drivers.

Since, the average fare per ride is higher in rural and suburban cities, hiring more drivers in these city types will increase competition lowering fare and therefore increasing market revenue for the company.

The average fare per driver is higher in rural cities therefore it might be easy to encourage more drivers in rural areas to join the company and work in rural areas.
